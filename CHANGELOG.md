  module targets Go v1.24).

## [0.19.13] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed

- Remove use of `slog.GroupAttrs()`, which is only available as of Go v1.25 (the

  functions from their respective packages, instead of the default Protocol
  Buffers struct representation.

## [0.19.7] - 2025-11-23

### Added

- Added functions to the `uuidpb` package for parsing RFC 9562 UUID strings
  directly into their various binary representations:
  - `ParseAsByteArray()` is equivalent to `AsByteArray(Parse(x))` but avoids all allocations.
  - `ParseIntoBytes()` is equivalent to `CopyBytes(Parse(x), dst)`, but avoids all allocations.
  - `ParseAsBytes()` is equivalent to `Parse(x).AsBytes()`, but avoids the intermediate `uuidpb.UUID` allocation.
  - Each function has a `MustXXX()` variant that panics instead of returning an error.

## [0.19.6] - 2025-11-22

### Added

- Added `uuidtest.Sequence` package for generating sequences of deterministic
  UUIDs for use in tests.

## [0.19.1] - 2025-10-11

### Added

### Changed

- **[BC]** Changed `envelopepb.Packer.Unpack()` method to a global function.

## [0.18.2] - 2025-10-11

### Changed

- Relaxed requirements of `message.Kind[Of|For]()` and `Type[Of|For]()` to allow
  calling with interface types.

## [0.18.1] - 2025-10-10

### Changed

- Relaxed type constraint on `message.TypeFor()` to allow any type that
  implements `dogma.Message` (not just those with pointer receivers). This
  allows use of `TypeFor()` in generic code that does not itself have a pointer
  constraint.

## [0.18.0] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- Added `MarshalBinary()` and `UnmarshalBinary()` methods to all stub types.

  identifies the message type.

### Changed

- **[BC]** `message.TypeFor()` now requires its type parameter to be a pointer.

### Removed

- **[BC]** Removed `marshaler` package. Messages, aggregate roots and process
  roots are now responsible for their own marshaling.
- **[BC]** Removed `envelopepb.Transcoder`.
- **[BC]** Removed `stubs.Marshaler`.
- **[BC]** Removed `envelopepb.Envelope.MediaType`.

## [0.17.0] - 2025-09-14

which itself includes a large numbers of breaking changes.

[Dogma v0.16.0]: https://github.com/dogmatiq/dogma/releases/v0.16.0

### Added

- Added `uuidpb.Derive()`, which returns a UUID derived from a namespace and
  name(s) using SHA-1 hashing.
- Added `uuidpb.CopyBytes()`, which copies the bytes of a UUID into a byte
  slice.
- Added support for `%q` verb when formatting `uuidpb.UUID` values.

### Fixed

- Set `IsSuperset()` and `IsSubset()` methods no longer produce incorrect
  results when the argument is `nil`.

## [0.16.2] - 2025-06-24

### Added

- Added `Update()` method to all map types.
- Added basic tests for processes to `enginetest`.

### Changed

- The `Set()` method on all map types now returns the map, to allow for easier
  in-line map building.

## [0.16.1] - 2024-10-05

### Added

- Added `message` package, which is a largely drop-in replacement for
  `configkit/message`.

## [0.16.0] - 2024-10-03

### Added

- Added `maps.NewFromSeq()` (and variants) which construct map types from
  `iter.Seq2` sequences.
- Added `sets.NewFromSeq()` (and variants) which construct set types from
  `iter.Seq` sequences.
- Added `sets.NewFromKeys()` (and variants) which construct set types from
  the keys of `iter.Seq2` sequences.
- Added `sets.NewFromValues()` (and variants) which construct set types from
  the values of `iter.Seq2` sequences.
- Added `Intersection()` method to all set types.

### Changed

- **[BC]** Changed message stubs to accept validation scopes.
- The results of `Clone()`, `Merge()`, `Select()` and `Project()` on any map
  type are now guaranteed to be non-nil.
- The results of `Clone()`, `Union()` and `Project()` on any set type are now
  guaranteed to be non-nil.

### Removed

- **[BC]** Removed `cmp` parameter from `maps.NewOrderedByComparator()` and its
  variants. The comparator logic must now be totally encapsulated by the
  comparator type alone.

## [0.15.1] - 2024-10-02

### Removed

- Removed `nocopy` protection from collection types.

## [0.15.0] - 2024-10-02

### Added

  `collections/sets` packages.

## [0.14.0] - 2024-09-30

### Added

  include the portable name as a parameter.
- Removed `Packet.PortableName()`.

## [0.12.2] - 2024-09-30

### Fixed

- Fixed error in `Marshaler.MarshalAs()` when passed a media-type that is
  unsupported because it does not have a `type` parameter. The implementation
  now correctly returns `false` instead.

## [0.12.1] - 2024-09-29

  the `configspec` package from `dogmatiq/interopspec`.

- **[BC]** `Map` is now a struct instead of an actual Go map. Iteration is
  provided by a new `All()` method that returns an iterator.
- **[BC]** `Set` has been renamed to `OrderedSet`, and is now a struct instead
  of a slice. Iteration is provided by a new `All()` method that returns an
  iterator.

### Removed

- **[BC]** Removed `MapKey` type.

## [0.10.3] - 2024-08-21

### Added

- Added the `enginetest/stubs` package as a replacement for the deprecated
